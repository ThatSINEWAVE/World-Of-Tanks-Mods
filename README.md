# World of Tanks Mods

Welcome to my GitHub repository for World of Tanks mods! This repository was created because the official WGMods platform from Wargaming takes an incredibly long time to accept new mods. Here, you can find my mods as soon as I finish working on them.

## Mod Requests

If you have any issues with the mods or have suggestions for future mods, please contact me via Discord at **sinewave\_** or open a discussion post on this repository.

## Installation

To install any of the mods, follow these simple steps:

1. Open the folder where you installed World of Tanks.
2. Open the downloaded archive.
3. Drag the `.wotmod` file inside the folder with the name of the current version of the game in your mods folder.
4. Start the game and enjoy!

**Note:** All mods in this repository are made by me and cannot be shared online or republished without my permission.

## Repository Structure

The mods in this repository are organized in the following format:

- Each mod is contained in its own folder, allowing for separate downloads.
- Within each mod folder, you'll find the mod itself and a short `version.txt` file.
- The `version.txt` file serves as a reference, providing information about when the mod was last updated, tested, and, if needed, a description of any fixes or changes made.

### Folders

- `GSOR_MAUS/`
  - `GSOR_MAUS__by_SINEWAVE_.wotmod`
  - `version.txt`
- `GSOR-E100/`
